 /*
 Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

example:

input := []int{1, 4, 6, 7, 7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 434, 834, 2}
result := 7
