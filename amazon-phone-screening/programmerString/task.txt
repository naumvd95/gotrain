Determine number of indices between leftmost and rightmost word occurrence. For example consider the following string:

progxrammerrxproxgrammer
I need to find the rx length which is 2 between the first progxrammer and second proxgrammer. To achieve this I need to find a way to identify a subset of the above string can be rearranged to form the word "programmer". As an another example consider this:

xprogxrmaxemrppprmmograeiruu
Again it should find pp which is between two set of programmer words.


Examples:

Input:
"progxrammerrxproxgrammer"

Output:
2

Explanation:
